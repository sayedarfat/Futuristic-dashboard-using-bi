# IPL Auction Strategy Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive auction strategy for a new IPL franchise. By analyzing historical IPL data, we aim to create a strong and balanced squad by selecting the best players based on various performance metrics.

### Key Objectives:
- **Identify High Strike Rate Batsmen:** Target batsmen with a high strike rate who have faced at least 500 balls.
- **Select Batsmen with Good Averages:** Focus on players who have played more than 2 IPL seasons and have a strong batting average.
- **Find All-rounders:** Identify all-rounders with the best combination of batting and bowling strike rates, who have both faced and bowled a significant number of balls.
- **Economical Bowlers:** Choose bowlers with good economy rates who have bowled at least 500 balls.
- **Hard-hitting Batsmen:** Target batsmen who have scored the most runs in boundaries and have played more than 2 IPL seasons.

## Project Structure

- **`IPL_Auction_Analysis.sql`:** Contains all SQL queries used in the analysis, including data retrieval, filtering, and selection of players.
- **Data Tables:** Assumed database structure includes tables like `deliveries` and `matches`, which contain detailed IPL match data.

## How to Use

1. **SQL Queries:** The SQL queries provided in the `IPL_Auction_Analysis.sql` file can be executed in a PostgreSQL database to retrieve and analyze the required data.
2. **Customize Queries:** You can modify the queries based on your specific requirements, such as changing the criteria for player selection or focusing on different metrics.
3. **Data Analysis:** Use the results of the queries to make informed decisions during the IPL auction, ensuring that you build a strong and balanced squad within your budget.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL Database with IPL data loaded.
- Basic understanding of SQL for executing and modifying the queries.
